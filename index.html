        <p>As an avid nerd, it was only a matter of time before I was drawn into the realm of coding. I began my higher
            education working towards an electrical engineering degree, but after realizing that college wasn't right
            for me, I searched for a reasonable alternative and am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through
            University of Washington. This fast-paced and highly focused style of education is far more suitable for me.
        </p>

        <p> I enjoy problem solving, playing games, and learning. My favorite things involve all three, such as
            multiplayer strategy games.</p>

        <p>My goals are to work hard so I can play hard, and in the process, make or do something I'm proud of. As I
            learn, I'll want to learn more. The more tools I have under my belt, the better my work will be, both in my
            job and in my side projects. </p>
